All functions except the add_songs_to_playlist assed out. 
That's the one that requires OAuth with active user authentication through Flask. Rest all can be done with simple passage of auth token. 

I imported Flask but it doesn't seem to be working. 
Need help in debugging

I also wrote the code for adding songs to playlist, review requested @roshan

Take a look.
